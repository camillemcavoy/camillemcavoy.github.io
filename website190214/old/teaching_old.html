				<br> <i>Head Teaching Assistant, Caltech Chemistry Department</i> 
				<br>Instructors: John Richards (2013), Scott Virgil (2015), Judith Campbell and Carl Parker (2016)
				<br>•Led a group of three graduate and two undergraduate teaching assistants (TA’s). 
				<br>•Prepared problem set and exam questions and graded problem sets and exams; organized a weekly recitation and conducted weekly office hours; organized reviews for the midterm and final. 
				<br>•Interfaced between professors, TA’s, and students to organize all course content (lectures, recitations, reviews, and assignments), and was honored for my TA work through an outstanding TA award and an invitation to a Caltech Academics and Research Committee (ARC) lunch.
				<br>•Feedback from Students: 
					<p style="margin-left: 40px"><br>"I absolutely LOVED Camille. She put so much time and effort into this class, and it was so very appreciated by the students. Without her, I don't think I would have done as well as I did in this class. Not only was she responsible and helped run the class efficiently, she was a very good teacher and helped explain concepts that I was confused about with clarity and ease. Camille was also very understanding of student concerns, and I was very grateful for willingness to accommodate student needs and difficulties."</p>
					<p style="margin-left: 40px"><br>"Camille is a hero! She put so much work into this class and was the saving grace. She tried to make the class doable for everyone, which I thought was wonderful. Thanks so much for your support this whole term, Camille!"</p>
					<p style="margin-left: 40px"><br>"The head TA, Camille McAvoy, is exceptionally awesome and dedicated, staying long after class and going out of her way to answer student questions and concerns. I know she has worked tirelessly to keep this course together...She is by far the best TA that I have had in any biology or chemistry class."</p>

				<br>•Conducted a weekly recitation section reviewing concepts from lecture and practicing problems similar to those found in assignments.
				<br>•Formulated problems for quizzes and exams and conducted weekly office hours.
				<br>•Feedback from Students:
					<p style="margin-left: 40px"><br>"Camille McAvoy is the reason I'm not failing chemistry. Her recitations were great and her notes were even better."</p>
					<p style="margin-left: 40px"><br>"Very prepared and very helpful for preparing us for sets. Great handouts. She pushed us to participate in section and made recitation engaging. Also easy to contact/communicate with through email. I would not have made it through this class without her!"</p>
